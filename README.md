Chess by me

Issues:
The game lags when either king enters check because I use exponentially layered forEach loops. Don't know how to handle legal/illegal move logic without that.

Missing/To add:
- En passant
- Stalemate
- Abort game/resign
- Rewind moves, see board in previous states
- Click piece -> click square controls, in addition to current drag and drop
- Visual stuff like animations probably
